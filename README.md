# pch_website

This is a website I created for my mom's business using Vue and Tailwind CSS. The current build of the website can be found at `http://3.89.252.12/dist/index.html#/`, which is hosted using an Amazon EC2 instance.

*Note: The website is still under development, so some sections and pictures may serve as placeholders for the moment.
